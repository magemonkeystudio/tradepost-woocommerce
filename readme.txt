A FREE Minecraft Donation plugin which works in conjunction with TradePost java plugin for Minecraft to provide a self-hosted donation platform.

== Description ==

Contribute to this plugins development on [Github](https://github.com/WooMinecraft/woominecraft-wp) if you'd like.

This plugin works in conjunction with our [WooMinecraft JAVA Plugin](https://github.com/WooMinecraft/WooMinecraft) for Minecraft on GitHub
and is intended for Minecraft servers.  This plugin allows you to add commands to your [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) products to have
them executed on your server, once a user purchases that product.

We're providing this to you in full faith you'll follow the [Mojang Donation Guidelines](https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation-the-follow-up-qa/).

Supports the following:

* Multiple commands per product
* Multiple commands per product variation
* Multiple Servers
* MC Username verification ( we only support paid legit accounts via the Mojang API )
* Resend Donations per-order ( should you need to wipe your server ).
* More to come?!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this support recurring payments? =
No, this only provides commands for products.

= Will you support offline servers? =
No, under no circumstances will we ever support offline servers.

= What payment gateways does this support? =
Anything? Well to be honest, this plugin does not mess with gateways at all. It relies solely on WooCommerce for the
payments - [check google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Woocommerce+payment+gateways)

= I just got a donation but it's not being sent! =
The order must be set to 'completed' in order for the order to be sent, that is the ONLY status that we're hooked into.

= This plugin sucks, BuyCraft is better =
Yea sure, we've all use to BuyCraft, but well, it doesn't have the flexibility of Woocommerce, and it's not free... and it's not open source... etc... need I say more?
